\title{Variable Importance in BART Model}
\usage{
variable_importance(bart_model, cutoff = 0, n_repeats = 10, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{bart_model}{A BART model object.}

\item{cutoff}{A numeric threshold for converting predicted probabilities into presence-absence.}

\item{n_repeats}{An integer indicating the number of times to repeat the permutation for each variable.}

\item{seed}{An optional seed for random number generation.}
}
\description{
This function computes the variable importance scores for a fitted BART (Bayesian Additive Regression Trees) model
using a permutation-based approach. It measures the impact of each predictor variable on the model's performance
by permuting the values of that variable and evaluating the change in performance (F-score is the performance metric).
