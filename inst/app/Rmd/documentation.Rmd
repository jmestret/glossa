## **Quick reference guide**

### Key Tabs Overview

- **Home**: Start here to access tutorials, documentation, and the demo video.
- **New Analysis**: Set up your species distribution model. Upload data, select options, and run the analysis.
- **Reports**: View and explore analysis results with visualizations and metrics.
- **Exports**: Download your analysis results, including predictions and model data.

### Data Requirements

1. **Occurrences**: Upload a CSV file with columns `decimalLongitude`, `decimalLatitude`, `pa`, and `timestamp`.
2. **Environmental Data**: Upload a ZIP file containing raster files, organized by variable and time period.
3. **Optional Files**:
   - **Projection Layers**: ZIP files matching the structure of your environmental data for predictions.
   - **Study Area**: A polygon file to define your study area and filter data.

### Analysis Options

- **Model Types**:
  - **Native Range**: Includes environmental variables + spatial smoother.
  - **Suitable Habitat**: Includes only environmental variables.
- **Functional Responses**: Check to generate response curves.
- **Cross-Validation**: Perform 5-fold cross-validation.

### Advanced Options

- **Occurrences Thinning**: Round coordinates to apply spatial thinning.
- **Standardize Covariates**: Normalize data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.
- **Enlarge Polygon**: Apply a buffer to expand the polygon if needed.
- **Model Selection**: Currently, only BART is available.
- **Set a Seed**: For reproducibility.

### Viewing Results

- **Species Selector**: Choose the species to view results for.
- **Key Metrics**: View suitable habitat area, mean probability, and number of points used.
- **Prediction Maps**: Toggle between fitting layers and projection layers.
- **Response Curves & Variable Importance**: Analyze the relationship between variables and species presence.

### Exporting Results

- **Exports Tab**: Download prediction maps, model data, variable importance, and cross-validation results.
