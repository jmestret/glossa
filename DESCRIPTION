Description: A user-friendly 'shiny' application for Bayesian machine
    learning analysis of marine species distributions. GLOSSA (Global
    Species Spatiotemporal Analysis) uses Bayesian Additive Regression
    Trees (BART) to model species distributions with intuitive workflows
    for data upload, processing, model fitting, and result visualization.
    It supports presence-absence and presence-only data (with
    pseudo-absence generation), spatial thinning, cross-validation, and
    scenario-based projections.  GLOSSA is designed to facilitate
    ecological research by providing easy-to-use tools for analyzing and
    visualizing marine species distributions across different spatial and
    temporal scales.
